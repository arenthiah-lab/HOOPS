# HOOPS
Relational Database with Mock transactional data, examined with MS SQL 

**HOOPS 4 ALL** was a business databases class project that marked my introduction to MS SQL and database design. My team and I conceptualized a sports industry startup and built a relational database from the ground up to manage and track transactional data.

This project transformed my foundational SQL knowledge into practical, business-driven skills. I gained hands-on experience designing an end-to-end database solution—from initial schema design through implementation—ensuring we captured all critical data points needed for business operations and analysis.

My SQL capabilities grew significantly through creating stored procedures and views, troubleshooting errors, and writing queries that would drive operational efficiency for a hypothetical startup. This project demonstrated my ability to translate business requirements into functional database architecture while developing the problem-solving mindset essential for real-world data work.
